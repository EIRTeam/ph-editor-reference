# Why use the PH editor?

If you already have *Project Heartbeat* and you are only planning on creating charts for it[^chart_exporting_note], then the PH editor is the obvious choice. However, it is not the only choice. There are other editors which might be a better fit for you, depending on your needs. We provide [importing tools](manual/imports/index.md) for all of these, so you can still use them to publish PH charts.

The following chart outlines the differences between all of these editors. None of them are necessarily "better" than the others, they just fill different roles, so use what suits your needs, or what feels best for you.
