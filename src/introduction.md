# Introduction

Welcome to the **PH Editor Reference Manual**. Here, you will find all the information related to the Chart Editor that is included with [Project Heartbeat](https://ph.eirteam.moe/) (or *PH* for short), a Rythm Game inspired by the Project Diva series.

The editor supports both ***Console*** (with *Doubles*, *Sustains* and *Hearts*) and ***Arcade*** (with *Multinotes*, *Holds* and *Slides*) charting. Mixing both is possible, but discouraged outside of expert use.
