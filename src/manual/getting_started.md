# Getting Started

## Installing the Beta Editor

The Editor has undergone a lot of major changes recently, and this Reference is written for this new version, commonly called the ***Beta Editor*** or the ***New Editor***. 
To install the beta, first go to the Steam Library page for Project Heartbeat, and then press *Manage* (The cog icon) -> *Properties*.
